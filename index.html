      <p>I am Tejobhasa, and live in Yangon. I love learning and teaching. 
        Now I am learning mordern technologies such as HTML, CSS. JAVASCRIP, and etc and Chinese language from my beloved teachers. 
        On the other hand, I share my knowledge of Buddhism to laypeople. I like eating rice and curry and Japanese noddle as well.
      Sometimes,  I think that what is important in my life. Because I spent my time by learning for two decades but only learning is not enough work.
    Therefore, I encorage myself to a professional teacher and work for others</p>
